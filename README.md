# lab_country

First exposure to fetching data from external API. The app features a basic system 
to display countries. It has two options for choosing from countries to show more
details. The first some is a simple drop down menu which populated with the names of 
the countries. The second option is a search bar which is filtering through the 
countries and showing the countires based on user input. The exciting experience with
the app was that its shows every country which includes what ever the user input is 
and it updates on user input change.
